GNU Japanese Documentation package version 0.0.


This is the GNU Japanese Documentation package. We intend to make a
package for Japanese documents about the GNU Project, and provide
simple and easy installation methods for end-users.

For instructions on installing the package, see the file `INSTALL'.

The latest package can be obtained from our cvs server; The cvsroot
is `:pserver:guest@openlab.ring.gr.jp:/circus/cvsroot',
and the module name is `gnujdoc'. The password for the `guest' user
is `guest'.

If you want to get only a part of gnujdoc documents, you may get the
top-level directory and subdiretories that you want, like this:

$ cvs -d :pserver:guest@openlab.ring.gr.jp:/circus/cvsroot \
    checkout -l gnujdoc
$ cvs -d :pserver:guest@openlab.ring.gr.jp:/usr/local/cvsroot \
    checkout gnujdoc/automake

Please refer to the file `MANUALS' to see what manuals are included
in the package.

Bug reports for the package should be sent to the gnujdoc mailing-list
<gnu-devels-jp@gnu.org>. If you are interested in this project, then join
the mailing-list `gnu-devels-jp@gnu.org'. How to join the mailing-list is
described in <URL:http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gnu-devels-jp>.
