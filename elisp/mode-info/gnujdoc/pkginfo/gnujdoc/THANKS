Gnujdoc would not be what it is today without the invaluable help of
everybody who was kind enough to spend time testing it and reporting
bugs.

The following people made especially gracious contributions of their
time and energy in helping to track down bugs, add new features, and
generally assist in the gnujdoc maintainership process:

HAGINO "itojun" Junichiro <itojun@iijlab.net> contributed Japanese
translation of autoconf manual.

IIDA Yosiaki made many contributions to GDB translation.

SAWADA Hodaka <hoda@ellis.cc.kogakuin.ac.jp> contributed the machine
for the CVS server.
